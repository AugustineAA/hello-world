Practice repository

Author: Angel Augustine

Notes on Github:
-create a branch off of the master branch to add work to the repository that is not ready to be saved to the master.
-you commit when you are ready to add your changes to the master. always add a note so that users can see a history of changes made and why
-when you open a pull request on the changes you committed, you are suggesting to others that you're changes be looked over and accepted
